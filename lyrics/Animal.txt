It's an empty shell I live in
The doors are always closed
And I spend my weeks
Losing my head, resting my bones

And they say that nothing's given
So I guess I'll get nothing at all
And I'll accept defeat
'Cause you can't swing
When the fight's lost
You know

Can't see the grass getting greener 'cause
Out here ain't nothing but blue
And your eyes blood red, the high helps a little
But everyone you meet's just passing through
White lies take all of the color from you
Most nights you don't sleep at all
In your blackout blinds you hide
Is there any wonder no one ever really tries to call?
And you say

Ooh, sometimes I feel like an animal
Ooh, I climb so high just to feel the fall and let it go
So look me in the eyes, am I someone else?
Ooh, sometimes I feel like an animal
An animal, an animal

And I always have a vision
But I always watch it go
And then I feel too weak
And it's too much, and it's too close, mm-mm

Can't see the grass getting greener 'cause
Out here ain't nothing but blue
And your eyes blood red, the high helps a little
But everyone you meet's just passing through
White lies take all of the color from you
Most nights you don't sleep at all
In your blackout blinds you hide
Is there any wonder no one ever really tries to call?
You say

Ooh, sometimes I feel like an animal
Ooh, I climb so high just to feel the fall and let it go
So look me in the eyes, am I someone else?
Ooh, sometimes I feel like an animal
An animal, an animal

Can't see the grass getting greener 'cause
Out here ain't nothing but blue
And your eyes blood red, the high helps a little
But everyone you meet's just passing through
You say

Ooh, sometimes I feel like an animal
Ooh, I climb so high just to feel the fall and let it go
So look me in the eyes, am I someone else?
Ooh, sometimes I feel like an animal
An animal, an animal

Ooh
Ooh
