I think I found a fear of mine
That you might love for no reason
You know I worry
Only luck brought me to you
I'm half awake most of the time
It's just the timing of the seasons
So you know I worry
That you're all I have to lose
And I should change this way of thinking
That all my fears are facts of life
But I could die tomorrow
You'd be close behind
Ooh, ooh, close behind
I live my life in years to come
To prepare myself for sorrow
So I won't worry
When I crumble at your feet
It's something sinister to love
Without regard for dear tomorrow
To search for worry
Is to love without deceit
And I should change this way of thinking
That all my fears are facts of life
But I could die tomorrow
You'd be close behind
Ooh, ooh, close behind
And I should change this way of thinking
That all my fears are facts of life
But I could die tomorrow
You'd be close behind
So I fill my days with thinking
Though I'm years from my true time
I could die tomorrow
You'd be close behind
Close behind
