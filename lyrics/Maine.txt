Tell me, lover
Now that you made your change
Was your soul rediscovered?
Was your heart rearranged?

Are you still takin' pills in the mornin'?
And did you lose that longin' now
For a walk through an ocean town?
'Cause this town's just an ocean now

You don't hate the summers
You're just afraid of the space
Askin' strangers for answers
To forget what they say

A boat beside a dock in the sunlight
And nothin' but the water and the sunrise now
Just the lack of an open mouth
'Cause this town's just an ocean now

Bad
I miss this place, your head and your heart
And my dad
Still tells me when they're playin' your songs

Laughin' at the way
That you would say, "If only, baby
"There were cameras in the traffic lights
They'd make me a star
They'd make me a star"

I wanna go
To Maine
I wanna go
To Maine

Bad
I miss this place, your head and your heart
And my dad
Still tells me when they're playin' your songs

Laughin' at the way
That you would say, "If only, baby"
There were cameras in the traffic lights
They'd make me a star
They'd make me a star"

I wanna go
To Maine, ooh-ooh, oh
I wanna go
To Maine, mm, God

Tell me, lover
Once you've had a change of heart
'Cause we're no more than the fossils
On Crescent Beach State Park, and we

Used to sing along to church bells on Sundays
And can you even hear 'em from the subway now?
And I hope that we make you proud
'Cause this town's just an ocean now
