Oh, she hates to say goodbye
So she only says goodnight
When she goes, she stops to look behind
And I'll sink

Oh, she sleeps with one eye closed
So she can tell when she's alone
Oh no, this summer comes and goes
But I'll sink

Oh, she's the sunset in the west
Oh, she's sleep when I need rest
And though this ship can be saved yet
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again

Oh, she promises to write
I know, it's harder if she tries
So, I have grown
To tell myself a lie and I'll sink

Time slows to let me jog along
High hopes, don't last me very long
But winding roads, they never seem to stop
And I'll sink

Oh, she's the sunset in the west
Oh, she's sleep when I need rest
And though the ship can be saved yet
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh I, would never sink again
And oh I, would never sink again
And oh I, would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again

Oh, she's the path on which I tread
Oh, she's the shiver up my neck
Oh, she's the blood rush to my head
Oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
