Breathin' in, breathin' out
How you been? You settled down?
You feelin' right? You feelin' proud?
How are your kids? Where are they now?

You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your friends, you lose your wife
You settle into routine
Where are you? What does it mean?

If I get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold

If the sun don't rise
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light

You bought some -, you search online
You're gettin' lost, you're gettin' high
All alone, late in life
Scared to live, scared to die

You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your kids, you lose your wife
You settle down, you're feelin' lost
You're gettin' stoned, then kickin' rocks (three, four)

If I get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold

If the sun don't rise
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light

Oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh-oh-ah-ah (yeah)

If you get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold

If the sun don't shine
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light

Sick
