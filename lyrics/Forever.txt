Let's drive for no reason, let's see where these wheels land
Let's grind down the curve of this earth
You look fine in the evening, honey, it's starting to storm

When we kissed in the car in the school parking lot
Where I'd go with my friends to get drunk
Used to wish I meant anything to anywhere, to anyone

When forever was a sentence, sentence to death
Oh, when you were a running tear, I was a drop of sweat
And, the edges of your soul, I haven't seen yet
And I'm glad I get forever to see where you went

I won't be alone for the rest of my life
I'll build a boat for when the river gets high
And I'll meet a girl in the heat of July
And I'll tell her so she knows

That I'm broke, but I'm real rich in my head
That I broke a bone that never healed in my hand
So, when I hold her close, I might loosen my grip
But I won't ever let her go
I won't ever let her go
Whoo

Remember when we called the cops
'Cause we got too high, and you got scared
And the cops just laughed?

We can't make rent, so we window-shop
In the Upper West Side, oh my God
Could you imagine that?

I won't be alone for the rest of my life
I'll build a boat for when the river gets high
And I'll meet a girl in the heat of July
And I'll tell her so she knows

That I'm broke, but I'm real rich in my head
That I broke a bone that never healed in my hand
So, when I hold her close, I might loosen my grip
But I won't ever let her go
I won't ever let her go

When forever was a sentence, sentence to death
Oh, when you were a running tear, I was a drop of sweat
And, the edges of your soul, I haven't seen yet
Now I'm glad I get forever to see where you went

To see where you went
