You're weak on the surface
You speak when you're nervous
And all the wrong words unite in your head
You can't stand the space in your bed
So you shake in the darkness
You break like an artist
And all your big plans are small the next day
You can't wait to throw them away
You perseverate
And the truth might be a million miles away
Hide your secrets, disguise your weakness
And lose yourself inside your busy head
Burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
All alone inside your busy head
Your busy head
You sleep in the moment, but dream like a poet
And all your good grace, like faded tattoos
You spend your days in wait for bad news
So you perseverate
And the truth might be a million miles away
Hide your secrets, disguise your weakness
And lose yourself inside your busy head
Burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
All alone inside your busy head
Going nowhere fast enough to tell a lie
Give yourself an alibi
You've been gone lately
Stand upon your peace of mind
You're bound to fall if you take your time
'Cause we're all waiting
And you can step alone into the abyss
Find a home on the edge of it
And be defined by its presence
By its size and its message
You can move along through the dark
And when you wonder where you are
You'll be proud of your weakness
So, busy head, just keep breathing, no
Oh, busy head, just keep breathing
Oh, busy head, just
Hide your secrets, disguise your weakness
And lose yourself inside your busy head
Burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
All alone inside your busy head
You're all alone inside your busy head
You're all alone inside your busy head
your busy head
