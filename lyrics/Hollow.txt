I like to think I'm more than what my age is
With my fucked up sense of patience
And my deep self-deprecations
I, I try to cope with all the changes
When I smile on rare occasions
Can you see how old my face is?
If I'm getting old, I'm getting old, I'm getting old
Why are there so many things that I don't know, that I don't know?
Wake up every day and put on my clothes
Hoping that 401k might fill up the hole in my soul
But I'm hollow, yeah, I'm hollow
I'm scared to check the date, I'm scared of the dark
You can't escape it, no matter how fast the car
When you're hollow and I'm hollow
I act like it's a choice that I'm still single
I'm smaller than the raindrops on the window
I'm colder than the backside of a pillow
And I've tried to hold my temper and obscure my rage
But these kids, they never act their age
And I've got one foot in the grave
If I'm getting old, I'm getting old, I'm getting old
Why are there so many things that I don't know, that I don't know?
Wake up every day and put on my clothes
Hoping that 401k might fill up the hole in my soul
But I'm hollow, yeah, I'm hollow
I'm scared to check the date, I'm scared of the dark
You can't escape it, no matter how fast the car
When you're hollow and I'm hollow
I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow
I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow
Who do you wanna be in fifty years?
I'm saying, "I just want to be alive"
Well, where the fuck do you think you are?
Oh, welcome to the other side
I wake up every day and put on my clothes
Hoping the 401k might fill up the hole in my soul
But I'm hollow, yeah, I'm hollow
I'm scared to check the date, I'm scared of the dark
You can't escape it, no matter how fast the car
When you're hollow and I'm hollow
I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow
I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow
