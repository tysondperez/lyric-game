Air in my lungs 'til the road begins
As the last of the bugs leave their homes again
And I'm splittin' the road down the middle
For a minute, the world seems so simple

Feel the rush of my blood, I'm 17 again
I am not scared of death, I've got dreams again
It's just me and the curve of the valley
And there is meanin' on earth, I am happy

Ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, oh, oh

Past Alger Brook Road, I'm over the bridge
A minute from home, but I feel so far from it
The death of my dog, the stretch of my skin
It's all washin' over me, I'm angry again

The things that I lost here, the people I knew
They got me surrounded for a mile or two
The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm back between villages and everything's still
