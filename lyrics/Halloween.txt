I'm sailin' away to a place I'm afraid of
The dawn isn't here, the sun hasn't rose
I'm drinkin' my days with the coastal longshoreman
They got money to make and children back home

And the last that I heard you were down in New Orleans
Workin' your days at the print
I drink 'til I drown, and I smoke 'til I'm burnin'
Your hands are all over my scent

I worry for you, you worry for me
And it's fine if we know we won't change
Collect every dream in these old empty pockets
And hope that I'll need them someday

But the wreckage of you I no longer reside in
The bridges have long since been burnt
The ash of the home that I started the fire in
It starts to return to the earth

I'm leavin' this town, and I'm changin' my address
I know that you'll come if you want
It's not Halloween, but the ghost you dressed up as
Sure knows how to haunt, yes, it knows how to haunt

It's an ode to the hole that I found myself stuck in
A song for the grave that I dug
There's a murder of crows in the lowlight off Boston
And I see your face in each one

I'm losin' myself in the tiniest objects
I'm seein' my life on a screen
I'm hearin' your voice in a strange foreign language
If only I learned how to speak

But the wreckage of you I no longer reside in
The bridges have long since been burnt
And the ash of the home that I started the fire in
It starts to return to the earth

I'm leavin' this town, and I'm changin' my address
I know that you'll come if you want
It's not Halloween, but the ghost you dressed up as
Sure knows how to haunt, yeah, you know how to haunt

Mmm (ah-ooh, ooh), you know to haunt
Know how to haunt, mmm (ah-ooh, ooh)

I know that you fear that I'm wicked and weary
I know that you're fearin' the end
But I only tell the truth when I'm sure that I'm lyin'
So, I'm settin' sail once again
