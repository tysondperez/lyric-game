Two months since you got back, how have you been and are you bored yet?
The weather ain't been bad if you're into masochistic bullsh-
And every photograph that's taken here is from the summer
Some guy won Olympic gold eight years ago, a distance runner

And that makes a lot of sense, this place is such great motivation
For anyone tryna move the - away from hibernation
Yoo-hoo, oh-oh
Oh, no

Well, I grew up in the fallout from the riots in the '90s
Static cranes stand lifeless, castin' shadows on the town
I stare at that hallowed ocean as if to pick a fight
For the dreams my old man dreamt for me lay on the other side, yeah

I would leave if only I could find a reason
I'm mean because I grew up in New England
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them
Spend the rest of my life with what could have been
And I will die in the house that I grew up in
I'm homesick

I'm homesick
I'm homesick
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I would leave if only I could find a reason
I'm mean because I grew up in New England
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them
Spend the rest of my life with what could have been
And I will die in the house that I grew up in
I'm homesick, I'm homesick

I'm homesick
I'm homesick (spend the rest of my-, home)
Home (home, yeah, I'm homesick)
