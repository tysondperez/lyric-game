Two months since you got back, how have you been and are you bored yet?
The weather ain't been bad if you're into masochistic bullshit
And every photograph that's taken here is from the summer
Some guy won Olympic gold eight years ago, a distance runner

And that makes a lot of sense, this place is such great motivation
For anyone tryna' move the fuck away from hibernation
Yoo-hoo, oh
Oh, no

Well, I'm tired of dirt roads named after high school friend's grandfathers
And motherfuckers here still don't know they caught the Boston Bombers
Time moves so damn slow, I swear I feel my organs failin'
I stopped carin' about a month ago, since then, it's been smooth sailin'

I would leave if only I could find a reason
I'm mean because I grew up in New England
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them
Spend the rest of my life with what could've been
And I will die in the house that I grew up in
I'm homesick

I'm homesick
I'm homesick
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I would leave if only I could find a reason
I'm mean because I grew up in New England
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them
Spend the rest of my life with what could've been
And I will die in the house that I grew up in
I'm homesick, I'm homesick

I'm homesick
I'm homesick
Home
