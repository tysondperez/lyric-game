I'd change my name to find a space to get some rest
I'd give my face to find a place to put my head
But this is who we are
There's no glamour to it
I board the plane and sleep my way to LAX
I cried at the rain, but there's no way that I'm depressed
Oh, if I think too hard
I'm scared I might lose it
Oh
The Hollywood sign don't catch my eye much anymore (oh-oh-ooh)
Leave it to time to make me feel I'm getting old
I'm living with it
Give me the open mind that I had before
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm living with it
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm living with it
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Oh, I'm a cynic
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Give me the open mind that I had before
They sense the blame that comes with failure and success
Would it make me famous if I break down in the press?
And give them what they want
There's no effort to it
Oh
The Hollywood sign don't catch my eye much anymore (oh-oh-ooh)
Leave it to time to make me feel I'm getting old
I'm living with it
Give me the open mind that I had before
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm living with it
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm living with it
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Oh, I'm a cynic
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Give me the open mind that I had before
I miss the days when one was better than the last
I miss the taste of growing pains I knew would pass
Oh, I miss those thoughts
And that fear of losing
Oh
I don't know why I see no light in anything (oh-oh-ooh)
Leave it to life to turn my strengths back into weaknesses
But I'm living with 'em
So give me the open mind that I had before
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm living with it
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm living with it
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Oh, I'm a cynic
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Give me the open mind that I had before
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh) there's something missing darling, oh
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm living with it
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh) 'cause I'm a cynic, darling, ah
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Give me the open mind that I had before
