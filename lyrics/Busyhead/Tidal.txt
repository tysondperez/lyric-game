You knew me in my spiral
Happiness tidal
It comes and it goes
And I sank into the water
How I drifted farther
Away from the coast
Sometimes I get this feeling
I was breathing someone else's air
Two thousand miles away from home
Under that sky, I tried to make my peace with fear
So I guess I'll build a boat and live alone
Lord, I'll be the lost one (oh, oh)
Oh, I'll teach myself to swim and live in my head
And make sense of all my thoughts
And if I never reach the land or live again
Lord, I'll be just fine (oh, oh)
Yeah, I'll drift until I'm dead, and until then
I'll be the lost one, I'll be the lost one
I fell into a pattern
Where nothing would matter if I didn't care
To be so close to a coastline
To know that in my life, I'll never be there
'Cause sometimes I get this feeling
I've been breathing someone else's air
So I guess I'll build a boat and live alone
Lord, I'll be the lost one (oh, oh)
Oh, I'll teach myself to swim and live in my head
And make sense of all my thoughts
And if I never reach the land or live again
Lord, I'll be just fine (oh, oh)
Yeah, I'll drift until I'm dead, and until then
I'll be the lost one, I'll be the lost one
And it wears me out
All the demons underneath the tide
But I sink like stone
But all the weight of all these dreams of mine
And I wish you well
You can't save someone too far to find
But it's wearing me out
And it's stormy in the sea tonight, in the sea tonight
So I guess I'll build a boat and live alone
Lord, I'll be the lost one (oh, oh)
Oh, I'll teach myself to swim and live in my head
And make sense of all my thoughts
And if I never reach the land or live again
Lord, I'll be just fine (oh, oh)
Yeah, I'll drift until I'm dead, and until then
I'll be the lost one, I'll be the lost one
