What if I told you that I got sober? That I got older?
That I got that tattoo off my shoulder?
That I'm strong again? I'm fun again?
Would you love me then?

What if you saw me? What if you hate me?
What if I'm failing or mentally ill? Would you call me "crazy?"
Would you let me in, would you let me in?
Would you love me then?

I told you that my whole life, could've sworn I would die young
My last words, 22 years on my tongue
"I'm bad luck," I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck
You know that I spend long nights, brain fried, talking too much
I'm a booze-bag, do-bad, burnout, dead drunk
Yeah, I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

It's not your fault that my brain is vacant
That the world is trash and my dumb - just got completely wasted
You washed your hands of all my sins
Have I lost you then?

Sometimes I hate it, my lack of patience
How sometimes love feels like a noun in some new foreign language
And now my heart is bent and worn so thin
Can you sew the skin?

I told you that my whole life, could've sworn I would die young
My last words, 22 years on my tongue
"I'm bad luck," I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck
You know that I spend long night brain fried, talking too much
I'm a booze-bag, do-bad, burnout, dead drunk
Yeah, I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

So if you look back and you hate my past
Just know that I'm doing everything I can
I'm doing everything that I can
And if you look back and can't stand my -
I swear I'm doing everything that I can
I'm doing everything that I can

I told you that my whole life, ￼could've sworn I would die young
My last words, 22 years on my tongue
"I'm bad luck," I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck
You know that I spend long nights brain fried, talking too much
I'm a booze-bag, do-bad, burnout, dead drunk
I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck, I'm bad luck
