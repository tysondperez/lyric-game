I told you, love, if you could see it through my eyes
You'd understand my fear of everything in sight
I know I'd quickly sell my heart for some advice
On how to ease a troubled mind

My brain's a dog asleep that I cannot let lie
Cloudy head, though I can't find a single silver lining
Guess there is no hope for me in sight
To ease this troubled mind

I worry for the sun, yes, I worry for the snow
I worry I'll die young while I worry I'll grow old
Oh, I worry for the time I spent worrying alone
It makes me sad
It takes me back
I break in half
Ah-ooh, I break in half

I took a bus out to the city where you live
Eaves dropped on strangers' conversations with their kids
In hopes that maybe they'd say something relevant
To ease my worried head

Well, every mile that passed just amplified my fear
I started counting all the times I saw you last year
And suddenly it all became so clear
It was sadly making sense

I worry for the sun, yes, I worry for the snow
I worry I'll die young while I worry I'll grow old
Oh, I worry for the time I spent worrying alone
It makes me sad
It takes me back
I break in half
Ah-ooh, I break in half

I worry for the sun, yes, I worry for the snow
I worry I'll die young while I worry I'll grow old
I worry for the time I spent worrying alone
It makes me sad
It takes me back
I break in half
Ah-ooh, I break in half

I told you, love, if you could see it through my eyes
You'd understand my fear of everything in sight
I know I'd quickly sell my heart for some advice
On how to ease a troubled mind
