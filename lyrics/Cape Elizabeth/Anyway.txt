Dirt on your heels, you've made a mess
Down by the carpark, high off your head
Honey, don't worry, nobody's angry at any of this
Darling be patient, stare into the vacancy, take a deep breath
It's like when you're tired, you're someone else
Don't speak for some time to find those words inside yourself
Honey, don't worry, I'll do your laundry, covered in dirt
Darling, be patient
It's easy to break beneath the weight of the Earth
And I'll say
Always, I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break

I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes, you be my face
'Cause darling, I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway

Today you looked older than me
Hair in your face, it fills the space between your teeth
And all of your falling
Does it get exhausting? Have you gotten sleep?
You said you were sorry that you hadn't called me in over a week
And I said
Always, I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break

I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes, you be my face
'Cause darling, I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
And I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
And I said
Always, I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes, you be my face
Darling, I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway
