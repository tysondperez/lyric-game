Ooh, silence is makin' me nostalgic
Two sizes big, your shirt in my apartment
Oh, we were kids, but that don't make this less hard

If I could fly, I doubt I'd even do it
I'd probably get high and crash or somethin' stupid
You made Ohio feel just like Central Park

Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
And mine's full of receipts

Ooh, this town's for the record now
The intersection got a Target
And they're callin' it "downtown"

You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down

Gave me your word, and now I can't pronounce it
No thing so sure that I can't learn to doubt it
Now the state bird, it sings our song so outta key

Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
And mine's full of receipts

Ooh, this town's for the record now
The intersection got a Target
And they're callin' it "downtown"

You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down
And drag you back down

Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road

You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down
And drag you back down

And drag you back down
