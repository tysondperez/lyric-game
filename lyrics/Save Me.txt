I'm so passive, too sarcastic
Shut you out just out of habit
I don't know
So I spent five months out here treading water
Now I wonder why you bothered
I don't know
Let me go
Why do you keep reaching for my hand?
Do you see something I can't?
Why do you try to save me?
This fate is well deserved
I only make things worse
Why do you try to save me?
Have I served my sentence? Learned my lesson?
Healed those wounds from my indiscretions?
I don't know
Am I still so selfish? Exile ended
What do you see in my misdirections?
I don't know
Let me go
Why do you keep reaching for my hand?
Do you see something I can't?
Why do you try to save me?
This fate is well deserved
I only make things worse
Why do you try to save me?
And sometimes I pray
That maybe I will change
Into who you think I am
Why do you keep reaching for my hand?
Do you see something I can't?
Why do you try to save me?
This fate is well deserved
I only make things worse
Why do you try to save me?
Why do you try to save me?
