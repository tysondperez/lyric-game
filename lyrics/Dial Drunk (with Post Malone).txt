I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't takin' any fault

Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and the transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'd die a drunk, I'll die for you

I'll die

Drinks pourin', couldn't stop it
Turn another slow dance into a mosh pit
Tuck my head and I heard the lock and
Told him that my first car was a Crown Vic

Talkin' 'bout last time I was in the back of a cop car
I fell in love
And my face on a cold window, try to sober back up
And loosen my cuffs

And it's all the same anyway

Mm, I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

Well, I'd die for you

I beg you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back
"Oh, son, are you a danger to yourself?"

- that, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol (ooh)
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back (ooh)
"Son, why do you do this to yourself?"

And I said, "I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown," ah
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio, ah

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you
