I think I forgot the things I've done
It's just good to be alive
And I could stand great before the sun
Though it's getting in my eyes
And how was Salt Lake City, dear?
Do you feel me?

'Cause now you let your heart get filled
With someone else's love
And now you let your head get held
In someone else's arms
And if I die tomorrow, babe, would you feel me?
Feel me?

'Cause you were only a little bit of light
And you were only a minute of my time
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

Like I lost part of me out there
My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My, my, my, my
Even through the pain, I can't recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

And there was something in the air
As we drove your parents' car
Fire we both knew was there
But couldn't bring ourselves to start
I scream the words inside your head
And hoped you'd feel me
Feel me

'Cause you were only a little bit of light
You were only a minute of my time
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

Like I lost part of me out there
My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My, my, my, my
Even through the pain, I can't recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

I know
That the moment I chase is a race that I've already lost
But it's long ago
And you were only afraid from fear of being alone
And I'm sure
That feeling, the ache is better than nothing at all

Feels like I lost part of me out there
My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My, my, my, my
Even through the pain, I can't recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel
