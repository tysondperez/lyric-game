It's not what you think
These tears aren't some sweet response to tragedy
Today I can't say why they fall
Honey, it's all chemical
Don't be deceived
And don't take my bitterness as empathy
Darling, it's a broken bridge
Can you still get over it?

If you're not afraid of the water
You should dive right in
I'm not so brave, but I'm gonna give it a try
But it'll take a little while

Can you fix my flaws?
Are you a bad excuse for therapy?
How am I suppose to live, one foot out and one foot in?
I fear the fall
Right now, I just can't find the energy
Weighed down by a ton of bricks
I'm forgetting how to swim

If you're not afraid of the water
You should dive right in
I'm not so brave but I'm gonna give it a try
But it'll take a little while
Now, I'm not afraid of the water
I'll dive right in
And I can be brave, so I'm gonna give it a try
Now I'm not afraid of the water
I'll dive right in
And I can be brave, so I'm gonna give it a try
'Cuz you'll be on the other side
