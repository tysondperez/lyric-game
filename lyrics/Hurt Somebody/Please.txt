I stare at the headlights 'til I get my head right
And the dogs stop their howls on the porch
My head is an ocean and I'm getting homesick
For a place I've never known
And I just keep laughing when I'm stuck in traffic
At the metaphor I've become
Maybe I'm restless, a manic depressive
Or maybe I need someone, or maybe not
So please just give me something for the pain
'Cause my heart softens to your name
And when you're gone, I come undone
And when you're gone, how come I'm weak
And I walk wires and I pull teeth
And I'm so tired of chasing dreams
I need someone to wake me up
I need someone to wake me up
I remember the evening you showed me Cat Stevens
Now I fill the room up with "Father and Son"
Two minutes emotion, four hours I'm frozen
By the fear and the boredom
Now I've ran out of reasons to pick up the pieces
I just tried to recall what once was
Maybe I'm desperate, or manic depressive
Or maybe I need someone, or maybe not
So please just give me something for the pain
'Cause my heart softens to your name
And when you're gone, I come undone
When you're gone, how come I'm weak
And I walk wires and I pull teeth
And I'm so tired of chasing dreams
I need someone to wake me up
I need someone to wake me up
And I want you
Oh my god, I want you
To see me in this state
And I want to
Fill your sleep and haunt you
To see the mess you've made
You've made
And I want to
And all my dreams are no use
When I am wide awake
And I want to
Believe I haven't lost you
It's driving me insane
Insane
Oh
Lord, I hold myself to this
So please just give me something for the pain
'Cause my heart softens to your name
And when you're gone, I come undone
And when you're gone, how come I'm weak
And I walk wires and I pull teeth
And I'm so tired of chasing dreams
I need someone to wake me up
I need someone to wake me up
