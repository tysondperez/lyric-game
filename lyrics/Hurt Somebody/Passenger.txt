I think I've found a way to keep myself whole
I write my fears on green notes
I swallow my doubts away and watch them grow old
Is that why the past years seemed slow?
Take me, my heart and my soul
Pick me apart and look inside, inside
Fill me with dreams I can't hold
Keep me afloat in this cold world, cold world
Tell me it won't hurt
Now I, I'm your passenger
The old me, won't work
Now I, I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
Oh, I think I've found a way to keep my hands full
I spend long nights, oh, I question my self-control
Take me, my heart and my soul
Pick me apart and look inside, inside
Fill me with dreams I can't hold
Keep me afloat in this cold world, cold world
Tell me it won't hurt
Now I, I'm your passenger
The old me, won't work
Now I, I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
Now all of the debts that I owe
Oh, they keep me useful, my head held tall
And I can't accept what I lost
Though you can make me balanced, you can't make me whole
So
Tell me it won't hurt
Now I, I'm your passenger
The old me, won't work
Now I, I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
