So when my thoughts take off may I breathe deep
Lord, hold me strong when old loss comes to meet me
Keep my fingers crossed, keep my knees weak
Are we all such fragile things?
And may we remember the past but not hang on to our old ways
Let's pity laugh at the jokes we tell in bad taste
All my friends think I'm funny in a sad way
But they know not how they speak
Oh, my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck and open up those blinds
Oh, don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh, I catastrophize
Oh, I catastrophize
Let me see the world through the kindness of my dad's eyes
Let every photograph be taken from my bad side
So when the world sees my face they'll never ask why
I look the way I do
So let my soul be the only thing to guide me
I'll tour the world and hope my anger dies behind me
So if I fail I can blame it on bad timing
I'll love nothing that I can lose
Oh, my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck and open up those blinds
Oh, don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh, I catastrophize
Oh, I catastrophize
Oh, my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck and open up those blinds
Oh, don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh, I catastrophize
Oh, my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck and open up those blinds
Oh, don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh, I catastrophize
Oh, I catastrophize
Oh, I catastrophize
