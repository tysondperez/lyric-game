I thought I had somethin'
And that's the same as having somethin'
I get mad at nothing, blame my dad for somethin'
I pull no punches, then feel bad for months

Mm
Thought I was raised better, tried to fake better
Tried to blame weather and escape better
Hope the skin heals where the pain enters

But I finally got sewed up, I set a time, then I showed up
And, now, the weight of the world, it ain't so bad
Mm-hmm

I saw the end, and it looks just like the middle
Got a paper and pen and a page with no space
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication
And forgot how to cry, who am I to complain?

And now the pain's different
It still exists, it just escapes different
And evades vision, makes the rain different
Makes the news boring, and my rage distant

Yes, I'm young and livin' dreams
In love with being noticed and afraid of bein' seen
But I can finally eat and I can fall asleep
It's fine, fine, fine

I finally got sewed up, I set a time, then I showed up
And, now, the weight of the world ain't that bad

Well, I saw the end, and it looked just like the middle
Got a paper and pen and a page with no space
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication
And forgot how to cry, who am I, who am I to complain?

To complain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
To complain

I saw the end, it looked just like the middle
I got a paper and pen, but I can't feel the pain
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication
Then forgot how to cry, who am I to complain?
