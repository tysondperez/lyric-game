Oh, there was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back (yeah)

Look at me and don't you lie
I could be your sacrifice
But don't you hold your head up high
For bullshit, I do not have time

I can be an old tattoo
To remind me when I get bad news
That I do not exist to die
But live to die while saving you

Does it bite at your edges? Do you lie awake restless?
Why am I so obsessive? Hangin' onto every sentence
This town's the same as you left it, your page was blank, but I read it
I still dial 822-993-167

Oh, there was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

I'm runnin' out of tears to cry
They're gone before they hit my cheeks
Maybe it's the air out here
Or maybe something's changin' me

If you think that you could wake me up
Then you don't know how well I sleep
You love me and I don't know why
I only call you once a week

Does it bite at your edges? Do you lie awake restless?
Why are you so obsessive? Hangin' on to every sentence
This town's the same as I left it, my page is blank, but you read it
You still dial 822-993-167

Oh, there was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

When she calls me back

All the pain I should have saved
Oh, I was too afraid of livin' life in your footsteps
In your heart or in your head
Oh, I was too afraid of livin' life in your footsteps

Livin' life in your footsteps
Livin' life in your footsteps
Still, she calls me back
Still, she calls me
