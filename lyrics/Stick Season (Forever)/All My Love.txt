Okay (I feel good about this)

How have things been? Well, love, now that you mention it
My folks still talk, but they speak in these two-word sentences
I'm sayin' too much, but you know how it gets out here
No winter coat could keep out all the cold of your atmosphere

We once sang Retrograde, we'd shake the frame of your car
Now I know your name but not who you are
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood
It's all my love, you got all my love

I'm still out here with the pills and the dogs
If you need me, dear, I'm the same as I was
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood
It's all my love, you got all my love

You got all my love

Write me a list of how it is, of how it was, of how it has to be
You burrowed in, under my skin, what I'd give to have you out from me
But I still recall how the leather in your car feels
And at the end of it all, I just hope that your scars heal

We once sang Retrograde, we'd shake the frame of your car
Now I know your name but not who you are
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood
It's all my love, you got all my love

I'm still out here with the pill and the dogs
If you need me, dear, I'm the same as I was
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood
It's all my love, you got all my love

You got all my love

Well, I leaned in for a kiss 30 feet from where your parents slept
And I looked so confident, babe, I swear I was scared to death
My hands gripped the wheel, I smiled stupid the whole way home
Well, those five words in my head, you said, "I'll never let you go"

Oh, I sang Retrograde, we'd shake the frame of your car
Now I know your name but not who you are
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood
It's all my love, you got all my love

And it's still out here with the pills and the dogs
Wind chill this year stole the words from my tongue
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood
It's all my love, you got all my love

You got all my love
You got all my love
You got all my love
You got all my love
