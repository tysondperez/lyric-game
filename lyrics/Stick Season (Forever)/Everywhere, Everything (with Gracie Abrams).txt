Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's been a long year

Would we survive in a horror movie?
I doubt it, we're too slow moving
We trust everyone we meet

Two bodies riddled with scars from our preteens
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat
Stare at a drive-in screen

We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried, "Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh"

Everywhere, everything
I wanna love you 'til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose
Keep my hand in yours

Everywhere, everything
I wanna love you 'til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose
Keep my hand in yours

Ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Drive slowly, I know every route in this county
Maybe that ain't such a bad thing
I'll tell you where not to speed

It's been a long year and all of our book's pages dog-eared
We write out the ends on our palms, dear
Then forget to read

We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried, "Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh"

Everywhere, everything
I wanna love you 'til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose
Keep my hand in yours

Everywhere, everything
I wanna love you 'til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose
Keep my hand in yours

Everywhere, everything
I wanna love you 'til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose
I'll keep my hands in yours
