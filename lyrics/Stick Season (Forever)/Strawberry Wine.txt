Darlin', speak to me but don't you say a word
Light a cigarette, I'll watch it as it burns
Remember tellin' me that you thought you were cursed?
I'm in love with every song you've ever heard

If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood
If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood

I said, "Love is fast asleep," on a dirt road
With your head on my shoulder

Strawberry wine, and all the time we used to have
Those things I miss, but know are never comin' back
For you, darlin', for you
No thing defines a man like love that makes him soft
And sentimental like a stranger in the park
For a few moments, I see you

If I was empty space, and you were a formless
Shape, we'd fit
But love leaves little runway, and every time we run
Straight over it

If I was empty space, and you were a formless
Shape, we'd fit
But love leaves little runway and every time I run
Straight over it
