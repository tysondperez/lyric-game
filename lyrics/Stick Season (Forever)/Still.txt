I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

It only falls into place when you're falling to pieces
You find love that lasts a while 'til you lose the reasons
Saying, "God I'm alive," but the whole place is quiet
You miss something that you can't place, but you can't deny it

Don't know whether you want a place in the coast or the country
You can't stay here, it's hard to face and it feels too ugly
You light a fire inside yourself, let it burn
Stare up at a starless sky and you say

It's like I'm still here with you
It's like I'm still here with you
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

The past coming back with the light in the morning
Look down on myself like a patient in surgery
And I used to watch my mother move
Like God was in the room

It's a bottomless hole I've found out here with a trace of no one
Grab a past box of photos, I rip myself open
I'm in bed, and I'm wondering if I'm callous, but hoping
Can I fix what is broken?

It's like I'm still here with you
It's like I'm still here with you
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

It's like I'm still here with you
It's like I'm still here with you
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

It's like I'm still here with you
It's like I'm still here with you
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

I don't, I don't, I don't want to say
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

I don't, I don't, I don't want to say
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

It only falls into place when you're falling to pieces
You find love that lasts a while 'til you lose the reasons
You say, "God I'm alive," but the whole place is quiet
You miss something that you can't place but you can't deny it
