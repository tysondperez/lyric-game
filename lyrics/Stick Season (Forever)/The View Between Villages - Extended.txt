Air in my lungs 'til the road begins
As the last of the bugs leave their homes again
And I'm splittin' the road down the middle
For a minute, the world seemed so simple

Feel the rush of my blood, I'm 17 again
I am not scared of death, I've got dreams again
It's just me and the curve of the valley
And there is meaning on earth, I am happy

Ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, oh, oh

Passed Alger Brook Road, I'm over the bridge
A minute from home, but I feel so far from it
The death of my dog, the stretch of my skin
It's all washing over me, I'm angry again

The things that I lost here, the people I knew
They got me surrounded for a mile or two
The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm back between villages, and everything's still

When I-, for me personally
I found a town b-big enough for anything that I want
I mean, I'm not a city girl, by any means
Strafford, it still has a lot of meaning to me b-because I grew up there

Well, I guess it's a small- (ah, ah, ah-ah), a small community of, uh
People that really look out for each other (ah, ah, ah)
And that's the same way with anybody that needs anything
This-, this community is there to help

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh (whoa)
Ah-oh

The things that I lost here, the people I knew
They got me surrounded for a mile or two
Left at the graveyard, I'm driving past ghosts
Their arms are extended, my eyes start to close

The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm back between villages, and everything's still
