The only time I got to prayin' for a red light
Was when I saw your destination as a deadline
This is normal conversation, babe, it's all fine
Making quiet calculations where the fault lies
This is good land or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind
The college kids are gettin' so young, ain't they?
They're correctin' all the grammar on our spray paint
And I even gave up drivin' after nightfall
I got tired of the frat boys with their brights on
This is good land or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind
It makes me smile to know when things get hard, ooh
You'll be far, ooh, you'll be far from here
That while I clean shit up in the yard, ooh
You'll be far, ooh, you'll be far, far from here
So pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds'll still sing, your folks'll still fight
The boards'll still creak, the leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love
And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever
Sure will
We're overdue for a revival
We spent so long just gettin' by
That's the thing about survival
Who the hell, who the hell likes livin' just to die?
You told me you would make a difference
Well, I got drunk and shut you down
It won't be by your own volition
If you step foot outside this town
But it's all we've had
For always
So pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds'll still sing, your folks'll still fight
The boards'll still creak, the leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love
And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
Yes, you are
If you wanna go far
Then you gotta go far
