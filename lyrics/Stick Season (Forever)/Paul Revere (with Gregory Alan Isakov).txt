County line, I'm countin' down
Mailboxes until my house
This place had a heartbeat in its day
Vail bought the mountains, and nothing was the same

Yeah, the boys are drunk, the sun is high
The license plates "Live Free or Die"
It just ain't that simple; it never was
We'll drink 'til New Year's, then they'll leave me to clean up

One day, I'm gonna cut it clear
Ride like Paul Revere
And, when they ask me who I am
I'll say, "I'm not from around here"

I'll leave before the road crew's out
Before those joggers, looking way too proud
We'll turn up the music and I'll forget
Until it ends that I'm not ready to let go yet

One day, I'm gonna cut it clear
Ride like Paul Revere
And when they ask me who I am
I'll just pretend I didn't hear

It's typical, I fear
Folks just disappear
And when they ask me who I am
I'll say, "I'm not from around here"
I'll say, "I'm not from around here"

But I'm in my car, and I see the yard
The patch of grass where we buried the dog
And the world makes sense behind the chain-link fence
If I could leave, I would've already left

But I'm in my car, and I see the yard
And the patch of grass where we buried the dog
And the world makes sense behind the chain-link fence
If I could leave, I would've already left
I would've already left
