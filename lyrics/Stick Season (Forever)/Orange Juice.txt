Honey, come over, the party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you, we know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen, bought for the children
It's yours if you want it, we're just glad you could visit

Feels like I've been ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn't think to ask you where you'd gone
Why'd you go?
And you said, "Mhm, mmm"
And you said

You said my heart has changed and my soul has changed
And my heart, and my heart
That my face has changed, and I haven't drank in six months
On the dot

See the graves as you pass through, from our crash back in '02
Not one nick on your finger, you just asked me to hold you
But it made you a stranger and filled you with anger
Now I'm third in the lineup to your Lord and your Savior

Feels like I've been ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn't think to ask you where you'd gone
So why'd you go?
And you said, "Mhm-mhm-mhm-mmm"
And you said, "Mmm-hmm"

You said my heart has changed and my soul has changed
And my heart, and my heart
That my life has changed, that this town had changed
And you had not

That the world has changed, don't you find it strange
That you just went ahead and carried on?
And you know I'd say the last time I drank
I was face down, passed out, there on your lawn

Are we all just crows to you now?
Are we all just pulling you down?
You didn't put those bones in the ground
You didn't put those bones in the ground

Honey, come over, the party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you, we know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen, bought for the children
It's yours if you want it, we're just glad you could visit
