The only time I got to praying for a red light
Was when I saw your destination as a deadline
"This is normal conversation, babe, it's all fine"
Making quiet calculations where the fault lies
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind

The college kids are getting so young, ain't they?
They're correcting all the grammar on a spray paint
And I even gave up driving after nightfall
I got tired of the frat boys with their brights on
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind (a sound mind)

It makes me smile to know when things get hard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far from here
And while I clean - up in the yard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far, far from here

So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost

The birds will still sing, your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak, the leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love

And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever
Sure will (whoo-hoo-ooh)

We're overdue for a revival
We spent so long just getting by
But that's the thing about survival
Who the hell-, who the hell likes livin' just to die?

You told me you would make a difference
I got drunk and shut you down
And it won't be of your own volition
If you step foot out of this town

But it's all we've had
For always (oh-oh)

So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost

The birds will still sing, your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak, the leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love

And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever

You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far (you're gonna go far)
Yes, you are (ooh-ooh)

If you wanna go (if you wanna go) far
Then you gotta go (then you gotta go) far
You gotta go far
