I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
And it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't takin' any fault

Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
It's all the same anyways

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and the transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'll die for you

I'm untetherin' from the parts of me you'd recognize
From charmin' to alarmin' in seconds
I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize
But that's mornin', I'll forget it

And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up

I dial drunk, I'd die a drunk, I'll die for you
Well, I'd die for you

I beg you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
"Oh, son, are you a danger to yourself?"

Well, fuck that, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back
"Son, why do you do this to yourself?"

And I said, "I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown"
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you
