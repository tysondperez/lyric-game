Do you remember drinking in the parking lot
By the trailhead?
I see you for a moment, then the morning comes
And it's wasted
We listen to "Only The Good Die Young"
And we laughed about its statement
We walked in the same direction, but we both got lost
In your angst and my impatience

Did you find what you were looking for?
Some escape from your skin
You know that place you were dreaming of
Where all light comes in
I hope you know I grew my hair out long
And your sister's just fine
I keep burning my bridges down
Just to keep you alive

Woo-oo-oo
Woo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo
Woo

Do you remember looking from the fire tower at the sunset?
Jack White, prophetic on my speakers, "We Were Going To Be Friends"
Yeah, I guess I just got busy, only saw you every other weekend
Lord, I just moved to this city, hoping noise drowns out the regret

But did you find what you were looking for?
Some escape from your skin
You know that place you were dreaming of
Where all light comes in
I hope you know I grew my hair out long
And your sister's just fine
I keep burning my bridges down
Just to keep you alive

Woo-oo-oo
Just to keep you alive
Woo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo
Woo

They tell me grief is just love letting go
They say it like milk has been spilled on the floor
They say they don't know who I am anymore
Well, I just have never shown anger before

Still haven't found what I'm looking for
Some escape from my sin
You know that place you been dreaming of
Where all light comes in
And I'll keep growing my hair out long
Just to cover my eyes
And I'll keep playing that goddamn song
If it keeps you alive

Woo-oo-oo
If it keeps you alive
Woo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo
Woo
I just wanna keep you alive
