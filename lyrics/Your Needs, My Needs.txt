Oh, well, who was I?
Who was I to watch you wilt?

You ain't gotta tell me what it means
Trace the outlines of your dreams
You'll always be a flower on my skin
And the pain that I am in
Mm

It's all the same
The losin' touch, the waiting game
Across that county line
I promised to be there this time
Alright?

You were a work of art
That's the hardest part

Howlin' like dogs in the light of the moon
Holdin' our breath after 132
You asked me why I wasn't saying a word
I'm naming the stars in the sky after you

I was a work of art
That's the hardest part

To spiral out, to try and float
To see a friend, to see a ghost
Bitter-brained, always drunk
Rail-thin, Zoloft

Subtle change, shorter days
Dead-eyed, dead weight
Your life, your dreams
Your mind, your needs
And my needs

And your needs, and my needs

I spiral out, try and float
You see a friend, see a ghost
To see a ghost, to see a ghost
To see a ghost
