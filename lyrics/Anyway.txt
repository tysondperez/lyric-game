Dirt on your heels
You've made a mess
Down by the carpark
High off your head
Honey, don't worry
Nobody's angry at any of this
Darling be patient, stare into the vacancy
Take a deep breath
It's like when you're tired
You're someone else
Don't speak for some time to find those words
Inside yourself
Honey, don't worry
I'll do your laundry
Covered in dirt
Darling, be patient
It's easy to break beneath the weight of the Earth
And I say
Always, I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes, you be my face
'Cause darling, I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway
Today you looked older than me
Hair in your face
It fills the space between your teeth
And all of your falling
Does it get exhausting?
Have you gotten sleep?
You said you were sorry
That you hadn't called me in over a week
And I say
Always, I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes, you be my face
'Cause darling, I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
And I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather
(You know that)
And I say
Always, I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes, you be my face
'Cause darling, I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway
