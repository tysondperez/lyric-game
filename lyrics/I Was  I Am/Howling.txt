Where to begin? Oh, let's pretend we never met
So I can disappear a moment
I've been tryna swim with both my hands behind my back
My dear, I always feared the ocean
And somehow this one word in my mouth was left unspoken
And I won't admit my parents split when I got sick
But I refuse to be a burden
And I said
Is there something keeping me here for the minute, darling?
Did you find the key and what is the meaning of it?
'Cause honey, sometimes I feel this emptiness
Howling out
Is there something keeping me here for the minute, darling?
Did I lose my mind and am I still looking for it?
'Cause I don't know why I feel this emptiness
Howling out
Howling out
You're not alone, the world is small
And I am sick of all the talk of finding purpose
Love comes and goes but the big black dog, he trails alone
Am I the only one who knows him?
Now, and somehow I gained fifteen pounds but lost my focus
And I suffocate things slow until I'm just a black fly circling my bullshit
Oh
Is there something keeping me here for the minute, darling?
Did you find the key and what is the meaning of it?
'Cause honey, sometimes I feel this emptiness
Howling out
Is there something keeping me here for the minute, darling?
Did I lose my mind and am I still looking for it?
I don't know why I feel this emptiness
Howling out
Howling out
Deep blue, deep blue, 05072
Deep blue, deep blue, 05072
Where to begin? Oh, let's pretend we never met
So I can disappear a moment
I've been tryna swim with both my hands behind my back
My dear, I always feared the ocean
And I said
Is there something keeping me here for the minute, darling?
Did you find the key, then what is the meaning of this?
'Cause honey, sometimes I feel this emptiness
Howling out
Tell me one thing keeping me here for the minute, honey
But if I leave you now then what's out there waiting for me?
I don't know why I feel this emptiness
Howling out
Howling
