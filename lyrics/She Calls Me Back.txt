Oh, there was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back (yeah)

Look at me and don't you lie
I could be your sacrifice
But don't you hold your head up high
I do not have time

I could be an old tattoo
To remind me when I get bad news
That I do not exist to die
But live to die while saving you

Does it bite at your edges? Do you lie awake restless?
Why am I so obsessive? Hangin' on to every sentence
This town's the same as you left it, your page was blank, but I read it
I still dial 822-993-167

Oh, there was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

The radio is taunting me
Every song, a minor key
And I don't get much sleep most nights
I'm seein' you in every dream

If only I could wake you up
If only I could fall asleep
I'll love you when the oceans dry
I'll love you when the rivers freeze

Does it bite at your edges? Do you lie awake restless?
Why am I so obsessive? Hangin' on to every sentence
This town's the same as you left it, your page was blank, but I read it
I still dial 822-993-167

Oh, there was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

When she calls me back

All the pain I should have saved
Oh, I was too afraid of livin' life in your footsteps
In your heart or in your head
Oh, I was too afraid of livin' life in your footsteps

Livin' life in your footsteps
Livin' life in your footsteps
Still, she calls me back
Still, she calls me
